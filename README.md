# Flashcards Project

This is a project for studying flashcards. It allows users to create, edit, and study flashcards and organize them into decks.

## Backend
The backend is built using **ASP.NET Core** and follows a **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern. It handles business logic, event-driven architecture, and provides RESTful APIs for the frontend. For detailed setup instructions, see the [Backend README](BackEnd/README.md).

## Frontend
The frontend is built using **SvelteKit** and provides a modern, responsive user interface for interacting with the flashcards application. It communicates with the backend via REST APIs. For detailed setup instructions, see the [Frontend README](FrontEnd/README.md).
